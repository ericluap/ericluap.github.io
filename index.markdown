I am a first year PhD student in [Computer Science at UIUC](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) where I am working with [Talia Ringer](https://dependenttyp.es/). My research is in making interactive theorem proving a better tool for mathematicians.

### Formalization of Holder's theorem 

[Here is the homepage for the project](https://ericluap.github.io/OrderedSemigroups/) which inludes a [complete blueprint](https://ericluap.github.io/OrderedSemigroups/blueprint/).
Holder's theorem classifies the ordered semigroups that are isomorphic to a subsemigroup of the real numbers. My formalization in Lean involves developing the basics of ordered semigroups and groups that are not commutative. This is a key step in [the research I have done](https://www.garrettervin.com/additive.pdf) with [Garrett Ervin](https://www.garrettervin.com/).
